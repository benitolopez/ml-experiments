# ML Experiments

This repository contains my ongoing experiments with machine learning. The goal is to understand the fundamental concepts of machine learning (neural networks, LLMs, research papers, etc) and implement them from scratch.

## Current Experiments

- [xor](/xor) â€“ A simple MLP solving the XOR problem using backpropagation with configurable neurons.
